I have been thinking a bit about concrete prototyping plans.

I think we should implement, as a strawman:
  - the state of the game (on the server) is merely:
    is there a gold coin at that location
  - when you are at a location where you think a gold coin
    might be, hit the website on your phone
  - an "adminstrator" (ie one of us) will define locations and
    reward creation

Directions from the strawman example:
  - multiple types of rewards
  - ways to use rewards
  - extensibility / ease of creating more game-play
  - continual tracking versus checking in
  - story
  - game play
  - challenges to collect rewards

I think more-and-more that having a convenient way
to allow users to customize the world is kinda critical.
As a minimal prototype:  you could define a place, and give a picture
to display when you are there.  (or, more precisely, when we think
you are there: I suspect a characteristic element 
of the game is actually going to dealing with GPS suckage)


other points:
  - "comet" is the umbrella term for using HTTP responses as a sub/pub
    connection (ie streaming input from HTTP server)
